		<p> I have completed my MCA final semester exams. I am focused on producing quality work and making a significant impact. I’m happy to apply the experience and skills I’ve obtained in my academic career in order to manage projects through creative problem solving and innovative thinking. I possess a strong eye for details and can thrive independently as well as in a team environment. I love to take up challenging projects and work my way through it. I am a firm believer in learning through experience. I am an outgoing person and love travelling and exploring new places. I spend my free time reading articles, sketching or watching movies.</p>
